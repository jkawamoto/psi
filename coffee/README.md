CoffeeScript files for Node-RED
=================================
To use those scripts, you need to compile them to JavaScript files.
You can use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) compiles to do so.

Initialize
-----------
In top directory of psi,
```
$ npm install
```

Compile
---------
In top directory of psi,
```
$ mkdir dest
$ gulp
```
In destination directory `dest`, JavaScript files will be created.
